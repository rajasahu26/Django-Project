# Django-Project
I have crafted a web application for tracking family expenses utilizing the Django framework. Within this application, I meticulously devised and implemented Django models to facilitate the tracking of expenses, categories, and family members. Furthermore, I meticulously constructed views and templates to enable seamless operations such as displaying, adding, updating, and deleting expenses. To ensure secure access to expense data, I implemented robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms, safeguarding sensitive information from unauthorized access.
